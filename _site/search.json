It’s like being a detective, piecing together clues (or data points) to reveal the bigger picture. So, data storytelling is all about taking raw data and turning it into a story that anyone can understand, helping to convey messages and insights in a compelling and easy-to-follow."

    "text": "Spotify Audio Features\nFor every track on their platform, Spotify provides data for thirteen Audio Features.The Spotify Web API developer guidehttps://developer.spotify.com/discover/ defines them as follows:\nDanceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\nValence: Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\nEnergy: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.\nTempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration.\nLoudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.\nspeechiness: This detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively instrum-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\nInstrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”.\nLiveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\nAcousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\nKey: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.\nMode: Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\nDuration: The duration of the track in milliseconds.\nTime Signature: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure)."
